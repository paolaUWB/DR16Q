# ABSORPTION GUIDE## Uses for This CodeThis code is helpful to run multiple spectra and calculate their BI total, BI individual, vmin, vmax, EW, and depth. Also, outputs graphs of the spectra when absorption is found.- `BI_total`    - The total balnicity index (BI) value  of the spectra. It is the total because if there are multiple troughs you will have multiple BI values.- `BI_individual`    - The individual values of BI if theire are multiple troughs.- `vmins`    - The minimum velocity of where the spectra trough begins. For the DR16Q this is at a balnicity index limit value of 2000 and 0.9 % below the continuum. <!---    - ![Visually showing where the vmins would be at](..vmin.jpg) need to figure out how to insert photo --->-------------------------------------------------------------------------------## First StepsEnsure your pathways are correct. The first one is the `CONFIG_FILE`. It should be reading in a csv file, common practice has been for us to name the file being read as `good_fit.csv` but could have any other name. Just be sure to update that on the code:```CONFIG_FILE = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else os.getcwd() + "/../DR16Q_EHVO/good_fit.csv" ```-------------------------------------------------------------------------------> **NOTE(S):**> - csv stands for comma-separated values. They are just plain text files separated by commas.> - the `/../` signifies you are moving up two directories. Because `absorption.py` is in the `ABSORPTION` folder we need to go back two directories to start from the `DR16Q` folder and find the csv file from there.> >> *EXAMPLE:*>>>> start off at this pathway:>> ```  >> ├──ABSORPTION>>    └── absorption.py>> ```>> After the `/../` we end up back at the current parent directory:>> ```  >> DR16Q>> └── ABSORPTION>>     └── absorption.py>> ```-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

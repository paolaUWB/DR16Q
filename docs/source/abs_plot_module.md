# `abs_plot_module````{eval-rst}.. function:: abs_plot_module.draw_abs_figure    Makes a flux vs velocity graph, that also has the error vs velocity on the same graph. Has text that identifies     what the graph number is, what the spectra name is, the signal to noise ratio, and the redshift value used.        :param kind: redshift    :type kind: list[int]    :param kind: wavelength    :type kind: list[int]    :returns: velocity    :rtype: array[int]    ```

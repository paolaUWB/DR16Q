# Project Information

Quasars are the most luminous type of Active Galactic Nuclei. Both consist of a supermassive blackhole at the center with a surrounding luminous accretion disk. Quasars can expel clouds of gas outwards, which are called outflows. Historically quasar outflows have been detected by the presence of absorption lines in quasar spectra, with the most typical ion detected being CIV (Carbon ionized 3 times, or C3+). Some of these outflows reach relativistic speeds beyond 10% of the speed of light. Our team has built the largest database of these outflows, called extremely high velocity outflows. All outflows have been found to be variable between observations, but the exact cause of this variability is unknown. The most prominent theories are variability due to motion in and out of our line-of-sight, and the recombination/ionization of the outflow gas. While carrying out our study of quasar outflow variability, we found that several cases have a common minimum flux value but vary almost everywhere else within their absorption trough; we call this ‘strange’ variability. Its importance is that it can help us constrain the cause of variability since it sets restrictions on several absorption parameters: coverage fraction, how much the source of light is covered, and the optical depth, how easily light is able to travel through the gas.
